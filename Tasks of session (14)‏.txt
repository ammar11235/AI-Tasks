 Types of statistical tests and when to use each type with examples?
1-Paired t-tests: The paired t-test is a statistical test that is used to compare the means of two groups. The groups are usually matched or paired together in some way. For example, you might have a group of people who receive a new treatment and a group of people who receive a placebo treatment. The two groups are then compared to see if there is a difference in the mean scores. The paired t-test is also used to compare the pre-treatment and post-treatment scores of a single group of people.
2-ANOVA tests: ANOVA tests are a type of statistical test that is used to compare the means of more than two groups. There are several different types of ANOVA tests, including one-way ANOVA, two-way ANOVA, and repeated measures ANOVA. Each type of ANOVA test is used to compare different combinations of groups. The benefits of using an ANOVA test include that it is relatively easy to use and has high statistical power. Let’s understand with an example of where a one-way ANOVA test can be used. One real-world example of the one-way ANOVA in action is a study that can be conducted to compare the GRE scores of students from different income levels and find whether there are significant differences between the means of the three groups. One possible outcome of the tests can be that the students from families with higher incomes tended to score higher on the GRE than students from families with lower incomes. This study can be used to assess and examine inequalities in society.
3-MANOVA tests: MANOVA is a statistical test that is used to determine whether or not there are significant differences between two or more group means. It is similar to ANOVA, but it can be used with more than one dependent variable. MANOVA is a powerful statistical tool that can be used to examine the relationships between multiple dependent variables and a single independent variable. It can also be used to examine the relationships between multiple dependent variables and multiple independent variables. MANOVA is an important statistical test that should be used when investigating the relationships between multiple variables.
4-F-test: The F-test is a statistical test that is used to determine whether or not there is a significant difference between the variance of two or more groups.
5-Z-test: The Z-test is a statistical test that is used to determine the statistical significance of a difference between two groups. It is most commonly used when the groups are small. The Z-test is based on the standard normal distribution, which is a statistical model that assumes that all observations are drawn from a population that has a normal distribution. This test is used to determine whether the difference between the means of the two groups is statistically significant.
6-Correlation test (Pearson’s): Correlation tests are statistical tests that assess the strength of the relationship between two variables. The most common type of correlation test is Pearson’s Correlation Coefficient, which measures the linear relationship between two variables. Correlation tests are used in a variety of fields, including psychology, sociology, and economics. Correlation tests can be used to study the cause-and-effect relationship between two variables or to predict future behavior based on past behavior. For example, a correlation test could be used to determine if there is a relationship between IQ and income. Correlation tests are also used to predict future events. For example, a correlation test could be used to predict the likelihood of a person getting divorced based on their age and education level.

What is P-value?
The p-value is a statistical measure that quantifies the strength of evidence against a null hypothesis. In hypothesis testing, the null hypothesis represents a statement of no effect or no relationship between variables, while the alternative hypothesis suggests the presence of an effect or relationship.

The p-value is the probability of obtaining results as extreme as the observed data, or more extreme, assuming that the null hypothesis is true. It provides a measure of how unlikely the observed data would be if the null hypothesis were true. The smaller the p-value, the stronger the evidence against the null hypothesis.
